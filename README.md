<p align="center">Using pure node to create a simple web server that display webpages</p>

## ✨ Objective
Learn about the basic node libraries and how hard it's to do thing without a framework like express

## 🔧 How to get it working
First you need to be sure that you have nodejs installed, from there you can use it without any problems.
##
You need to run the src/server.js file with node.
```bash
node src/server.js
```
If you want to use nodemon you need to run:
```bash
npm install 
```
And then you can use:
```bash
npm start
```
With nodemon you get a hot reload that makes your process of development much easier.
